# 7-Segment Driver with Watch Application and Proteus Simulation
Welcome to the repository for our comprehensive project that brings together a 7-segment driver, a watch application, and a Proteus simulation. This project is designed to showcase the capabilities of digital display technology, microcontroller programming, and simulation in a practical and educational manner.

# Features
7-Segment Driver: This section of the project focuses on a versatile 7-segment driver implementation. The driver is capable of controlling multiple 7-segment displays, allowing for the display of numerical data, characters, and more. The code has been optimized for flexibility and ease of integration into various projects.

Watch Application: Experience the integration of the 7-segment driver with our functional watch application. The watch displays accurate time and offers user-friendly features that demonstrate the driver's potential in real-world applications.

Proteus Simulation: The Proteus simulation files included in this repository provide an interactive environment to simulate and visualize the behavior of the 7-segment driver and the watch application. This simulation allows you to experiment with different scenarios without the need for physical components.
